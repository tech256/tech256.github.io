            <h3>Lita Ignore Me</h3>
            <p>
                lita-ignore-me is a Lita extension that allows a user to tell the robot that
                he or she wishes to be ignored unless addressing the robot directly. This
                means that routes that are triggered that are not commands are not executed.
